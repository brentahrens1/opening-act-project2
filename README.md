**TECHNOLOGY USED -**

* HTML 
* javascript
* CSS
* SASS
* mongoDB
* mongoose
* express
* node.js 

**GETTING STARTED -** 
I began thinking of a concept for my app that would be important for me. As an artist I don't know of any well known sites that allow artist to connect for collaborations and to also search for venues that have available slots to perform. Once I realized the direction of the app I started with some basic layout and control flow wireframing.

**BIGGEST CHALLENGE -** the authentication. Making the models work together. Writing code that performs a different function depending on which model is being used.  

**FUTURE PLANS -** 
* Add a playlist for each artist on the profiles. 
* The ability to upload a new song to your profile. 
* A more direct way for artists and venues to be able to reach out to each other without leaving the app. 

**SUMMARY -** I think the foundation is here for an amazing app. There are functionality issues that will take more time to make this a fully functional app.
